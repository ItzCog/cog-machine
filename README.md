# Cog Machine

### Introduction

Cog Machine is a lightweight framework, capable of simple event loop handling.
It is mainly powered by the `cog` class, which is a base class with simple event
loop functionality and can be inherited and extended for complex functionality.


For a more detailed overview and a simple tutorial, please read the comments
inside the source code files `front_end.cpp`, `example.h` and `example.cpp`.

### Disclaimer

This framework is designed and implemented without any real purposes except for
entertainment value. I can not guarantee that this framework will work reliably
for anything, does not contain any bugs or glitches, has a competent efficiency,
or will receive any future maintenance and updates.

For any serious purposes, it's strongly recommended that you use a more complete
and robust framework, or write one on your own. To be honest, a vast majority of the
framework you find in other places will outperform this one in many aspects, and
by a large margin.
